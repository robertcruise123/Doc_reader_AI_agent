# Doc_reader_AI_agent
An AI agent which reads the uploaded documents , can handle multiple files and give detailed answers based on the questions asked.
The projec6 directory looks like:
app.py: The main Streamlit application file.
pdf_utils.py: Contains functions for PDF text extraction and token counting.
summarization_utils.py: Contains the summarize_document function for interacting with the LLM for summarization.
requirements.txt (Optional but recommended): A file listing all Python dependencies (streamlit, together, pypdf, tiktoken). You can generate this using pip freeze requirements.txt after installing dependencies.
